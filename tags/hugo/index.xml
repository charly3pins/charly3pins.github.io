      <description>After long time without writing&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m back!
I was planning to rebuild my site and start creating content again but never found the time until now.
I wanted to do my theme from scratch instead of using a predefined theme, so I had to learn how the templating and the content managing is done in Hugo.
Once I did that process, I want to sum up the most important things that I consider you have to know if you wanna do your own theme like I did (this site is the prove of that!</description>

      <description>If you want to create a fast static website I recommend you Hugo. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Go and it&amp;rsquo;s really use to configure and adapt to your needs. In addition, you can choose through different themes created by the team and others by the community or even create your own one.
Here I&amp;rsquo;ll explain in some steps how to create one blog with Hugo and how to be hosted &amp;amp; deployed in GitHub and GitHub Pages.</description>
