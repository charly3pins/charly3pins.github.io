      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a technical person and you don&amp;rsquo;t like to battle with presentation softwares but you want/need to create one, congratulations! you are in the right place. I know that as software engineers we want to be coding or reading or watching things related with software, architecture or devops but not with presentations. Sometimes we are demanded to present something to other team members, to the product owners or even scarier, to the management team!</description>

      <description>Assuming that you already installed git and configured it on your computer, let’s start from the beginning and check the initial commands for initialize and download a repository.
init git-init - Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one This command creates an empty Git repository (a .git directory in the location you executed the command). This folder will contain some files and subdirectories that I will not cover in this post because they are too advanced for what I want to achieve with these articles.</description>

      <description>Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system. Being a distributed revision control system means that each developer has each own copy of the project’s history locally, not like centralized ones that all developers have to point to the “one and only” server (like SVN). For that reason Git is faster than others, because almost everything is performed locally instead of remote calls to the centralized revision control server. Each repo provides a separato working tree with project files for each developer.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the CMF tool for the last one year and I think its simplicity is its potential. Basically it is a terminal tool developd in Go by Walmart Digital that helps you to standarize the commits log of your projects.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for the last year and a half approximatley and all I can say its very useful. We agreed with the team the configuration we want to use and defined a set of changes that applies in our case.</description>

      <description>After long time without writing&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m back!
I was planning to rebuild my site and start creating content again but never found the time until now.
I wanted to do my theme from scratch instead of using a predefined theme, so I had to learn how the templating and the content managing is done in Hugo.
Once I did that process, I want to sum up the most important things that I consider you have to know if you wanna do your own theme like I did (this site is the prove of that!</description>

      <title>Installing Drone 0.8 on Ubuntu 16.04</title>

      <description>I have to admit that I never liked the systems part of the development process. I always though that it was a job in a dark and creppy place, full of freaks doing a rare things. This vision completely changed when I started using Docker. On this point I realized that all the magic done in the sysadmin part was better than I though and then, I started intereseting more an more on this side.</description>

      <description>This is the first of a several articles I&amp;rsquo;m planning to write commenting the different exercises that I&amp;rsquo;m doing in Gophercises page.
 It&amp;rsquo;s a FREE course that will help you become more familiar with Go while developing your skills as a programmer. In the course we will build roughly 20 different mini-applications, packages, and tools that are each designed to teach you something different.
Gophercises I like playing with Go on this site because each exercise is focused in a set of packages of the language and the way of they are presented is really clear and easy to understand.</description>

      <title>Building static blog with Hugo</title>

      <description>If you want to create a fast static website I recommend you Hugo. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Go and it&amp;rsquo;s really use to configure and adapt to your needs. In addition, you can choose through different themes created by the team and others by the community or even create your own one.
Here I&amp;rsquo;ll explain in some steps how to create one blog with Hugo and how to be hosted &amp;amp; deployed in GitHub and GitHub Pages.</description>
